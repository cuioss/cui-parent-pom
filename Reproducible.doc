This document lists all concrete, actionable steps to achieve reproducible builds for this project, based on the current state as of 21. April 2025.

== Checklist for Reproducible Builds

- [x] **All plugin and dependency versions pinned**
  - All pom.xml files use fixed versions. No LATEST, RELEASE, or version ranges found.
- [x] **Maven Wrapper present and version pinned**
  - .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties exists and pins Maven 3.9.6.
  - mvnw and mvnw.cmd are present and committed.
- [x] **Java version set explicitly**
  - <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source> and <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target> are set in the root pom.xml and inherited by modules.
- [ ] **Reproducibility configuration in JAR/WAR plugins**
  - Add to every maven-jar-plugin and maven-war-plugin in all modules:
    <configuration>
      <reproducible>true</reproducible>
      <outputTimestamp>2025-04-20T00:00:00Z</outputTimestamp>
    </configuration>
- [x] **No non-deterministic resource filtering**
  - No resource filtering or timestamp/hostname/env injection found in pom.xml files.
- [x] **All GitHub Actions pinned by commit hash**
  - All uses: ...@... in .github/workflows/ reference full commit SHAs.
- [ ] **Deterministic file order/locale in assembly/shade plugins**
  - If you use maven-assembly-plugin or maven-shade-plugin, add configuration for deterministic file order and locale (not detected, but check if you add these plugins in the future).
- [x] **Build environment documented**
  - Builds are tested on Linux with Java 17 and Maven 3.9.6 using ./mvnw.
- [ ] **Test reproducibility**
  - Run two clean builds and compare artifacts with diffoscope or sha256sum. Artifacts should be identical.
- [x] **Review and repeat**
  - Periodically review dependencies, plugins, and CI for unpinned versions or new sources of non-determinism.
