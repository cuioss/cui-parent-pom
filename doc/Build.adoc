== Updating the Maven Wrapper

To update the Maven Wrapper scripts (mvnw, mvnw.cmd, .mvn/wrapper), run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw wrapper:wrapper
----

This will update the Maven Wrapper to the latest version provided by the takari-maven-wrapper-plugin.

== Reproducible Builds

This project implements several measures to ensure reproducible builds. The following practices are already in place:
 
* All plugin and dependency versions are pinned in all `pom.xml` files. No LATEST, RELEASE, or version ranges are used.
* The Maven Wrapper is present (`mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`) and pins Maven `3.9.6`.
* Java version is set explicitly in the root `pom.xml`, inherited by all modules.:

[source,xml]
----
<maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source> 
<maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target> 
----

* Reproducibility configuration is set for JAR/WAR plugins in all modules:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    <outputTimestamp>${reproducible.build.outputTimestamp}</outputTimestamp>
</configuration>
----
 
* No non-deterministic resource filtering is used (no timestamp, hostname, or environment injection in resources).
* All GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/` are pinned by commit hash (uses: `...@<commit-sha>`).
* The build environment is documented: builds are tested on Linux with `Java 17` and Maven `3.9.6` using `./mvnw`.

== PlantUML Diagrams

This project uses PlantUML for creating diagrams in the documentation. To ensure compatibility with GitHub's rendering capabilities, we follow these practices:

=== PlantUML File Structure

All PlantUML diagrams are stored in separate files under the `/doc/plantuml/` directory with the `.puml` extension. This separation allows for:

* Better version control of diagrams
* Easier maintenance and updates
* Compatibility with GitHub's rendering limitations
* Generation of PNG images for documentation

Each PlantUML file should include the following directive at the beginning to ensure it can be rendered without requiring a local Graphviz installation:

[source]
----
@startuml
' Configure PlantUML to use its own rendering engine
!pragma layout smetana
...
@enduml
----

The `!pragma layout smetana` directive tells PlantUML to use its own internal rendering engine (Smetana) instead of relying on Graphviz, which eliminates the dependency on the local filesystem.

=== Generating PNG Images

To generate PNG images from PlantUML files, use the `build-plantuml` Maven profile:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw generate-resources -Pbuild-plantuml
----

This command will:

1. Process all `.puml` files in the `/doc/plantuml/` directory
2. Generate corresponding PNG images with the same base name
3. Place the generated images in the same directory
