   - Verify state matches before proceeding

2. Progress Tracking:
   - Update after each successful step
   - Record timestamps for all changes
   - Maintain module/package hierarchy
   - Track phase completion

3. File Management:
   - Created at maintenance start if not exists
   - Preserved until maintenance complete
   - Archived with completion timestamp

4. Phase Tracking:
   - Test Refactoring
   - Code Refactoring
   - Documentation Updates
