1. These rules here apply to documentation, as there are javadoc and asciidoc
2. Documentation must represent existing types, methods and parameters
3. You must not introduce elements that are not there
4. You must double-check references whether they really exist
5. You should avoid duplication, use linking instead
6. If you are in doubt, leave it out
7. If you changed javadoc you must execute a javadoc module build and fix all errors and warnings
8. Code examples should usually be taken form the corresponding junit-tests
