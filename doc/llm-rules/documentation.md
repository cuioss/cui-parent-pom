1. Only document existing code elements - no speculative or planned features
2. All references must be verified to exist
3. Use linking instead of duplication
4. Code examples must come from actual unit tests
5. All javadoc changes require successful javadoc build with zero errors/warnings
6. Use consistent terminology:
   - Always use "Java beans" instead of "Jakarta beans"
   - Maintain "Java Bean Specification" terminology
   - This applies to all documentation (Javadoc, code comments, README files)
7. Code examples must follow these rules:
   - Must be complete and compilable
   - Include all necessary imports
   - Show proper error handling
   - Follow project coding standards
   - Be verified by unit tests
   - Structure:
     * Start with setup/configuration
     * Show main functionality
     * Include error handling
     * Demonstrate cleanup if needed
