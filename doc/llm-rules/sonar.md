# SonarCloud Analysis Process

This document outlines the process for accessing and reviewing SonarCloud analysis results for CUI OSS projects.

## Access Process

### 1. Get Current Branch
```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

### 2. Access Points

#### Dashboard View
```
https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=cuioss_<project-name>&branch=<branch-name>
```

#### Issues API
```
https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys=cuioss_<project-name>&branch=<branch-name>&resolved=false&sinceLeakPeriod=true
```

## Review Process

### 1. Quality Gate Status
- Check overall status
- Review failing conditions
- Note any quality metric thresholds

### 2. Issue Analysis
Review issues by:
- Severity (MAJOR, MINOR, etc.)
- Type (CODE_SMELL, BUG, VULNERABILITY)
- Impact on quality metrics
- Associated code locations
- Rule references

### 3. Code Coverage
- Overall coverage percentage
- New code coverage
- Uncovered lines
- Critical areas lacking coverage

### 4. Security Review
- Check for vulnerabilities
- Review security hotspots
- Assess security-related code smells

## Documentation Requirements

When documenting findings:
1. File and line references must be precise
2. Include issue descriptions from SonarCloud
3. Note severity and impact levels
4. Document any suggested remediation steps
5. Reference specific SonarCloud rules when applicable

## Integration with Development Process

1. Regular Review Points:
   - After major feature completion
   - Before creating pull requests
   - During code review process
   - Post-merge verification

2. Response Requirements:
   - Address all new issues promptly
   - Document intentional deviations
   - Track technical debt decisions
   - Update related documentation

## Success Criteria

A successful SonarCloud review should:
1. Identify all new issues
2. Assess impact on code quality
3. Provide clear remediation paths
4. Document findings appropriately
5. Integrate with existing quality processes
