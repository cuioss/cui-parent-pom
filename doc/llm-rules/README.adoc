# LLM Rules for CUI OSS Projects

Currently, we evaluate using https://codeium.com/windsurf[codeium/windsurf] for working with code-bases within the cui-projects.

This directory contains a number of modularized configurations aka 'Memories' that guide AI assistants in maintaining and developing CUI OSS projects.

## Available Cascade Prompts

[cols="2,4"]
|===
|Cascade Prompt |Description

|`prepare project for maintenance`
|Initiates standardized maintenance process including branch creation and initial verification

|`verify sonar`
|Accesses and reviews SonarCloud analysis for the current branch via direct URL

|`persist memory to repo`
|Updates documentation in the repository to reflect new or modified AI memory rules. Automatically updates this README with new commands and memory files.

|`execute java maintenance`
|Performs standardized Java code maintenance tasks including code cleanup, dependency updates, and code quality improvements according to project standards.

|`finalize java maintenance`
|Executes final cleanup and verification steps using OpenRewrite, ensures build stability, and prepares changes for review via pull request.

## File Descriptions

=== Documentation Rules (`documentation.md`)
* Ensures accurate documentation of existing code
* Enforces verified references and consistent terminology
* Requires code examples from actual unit tests
* Maintains zero-error javadoc builds

=== Maintenance Processes (`maintenance.md`)
* Defines standardized maintenance workflows
* Includes branch management procedures
* Specifies verification steps including SonarCloud analysis
* Establishes success criteria for changes

=== Project Standards (`project.md`)
* Mandates maven-wrapper usage
* Defines build and commit processes
* Specifies technology requirements (Java 17, Jakarta EE)
* Establishes library preferences
