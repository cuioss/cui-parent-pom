# LLM Rules for CUI OSS Projects

Currently, we evaluate using https://codeium.com/windsurf[codeium/windsurf] for working with code-bases within the cui-projects.

This directory contains modularized configurations ('Memories') that guide AI assistants in maintaining and developing CUI OSS projects.

## Purpose and Scope

These rules ensure:

1. Consistent code quality
2. Standardized maintenance processes
3. Uniform documentation practices
4. Reliable testing approaches

## Available Cascade Prompts

[cols="2,4"]
|===
|Cascade Prompt |Description

|`fix javadoc build`
|Fixes Javadoc build errors and warnings:
- Verifies build preconditions
- Fixes only Javadoc errors/warnings
- Makes minimal modifications
- Preserves documentation content
- No code changes allowed

|`prepare project for maintenance`
|Initiates standardized maintenance process:
- Creates feature branch
- Performs initial verification
- Sets up maintenance context

|`verify sonar`
|Performs SonarCloud analysis:
- Accesses current branch analysis
- Reviews quality gates
- Examines new issues
- Verifies coverage metrics

|`persist memory to repo`
|Updates documentation:
- Adds new memory rules
- Updates README.adoc
- Maintains documentation structure
- Ensures consistency

|`execute java maintenance`
|Performs code maintenance:
- Updates dependencies
- Applies code cleanup
- Improves code quality
- Follows project standards

|`finalize java maintenance`
|Completes maintenance:
- Runs OpenRewrite recipes
- Verifies build stability
- Prepares pull request
- Updates documentation

|`verify llm-rules`
|Reviews and updates rules:
- Checks consistency
- Updates documentation
- Refactors as needed
- Ensures completeness

## Implementation Notes

=== Documentation Rules (`documentation.md`)
* Ensures accurate API documentation
* Maintains verified references
* Requires test-based examples
* Enforces zero-error builds

=== Maintenance Processes (`maintenance.md`)
* Defines workflow standards
* Manages code quality
* Integrates verification
* Ensures consistency

=== Project Standards (`project.md`)
* Enforces build practices
* Manages dependencies
* Defines requirements
* Maintains compatibility

NOTE: This document is automatically updated when new memories are persisted to the repository.

## Contributing

When adding new rules:

1. Follow existing structure
2. Update README.adoc
3. Maintain consistency
4. Include clear examples
5. Document rationale

## Version Control

This documentation follows:

1. Semantic versioning
2. Conventional commits
3. Feature branch workflow
4. Pull request reviews
